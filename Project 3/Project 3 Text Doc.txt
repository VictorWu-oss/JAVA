The overall project was done step by step together. We ensured that each of us understood every step of the A* pathing algorithm and how to apply it to both SmallWorld and Project 3. After each of us used the algorithm on our projects, we created a final version.

Gary:
Applied and revised A* Pathing algorithm from SmallWorld to work on Project 3
Applied A* to own Project
Wrote test cases for Project 3

Victor: 
Developed and applied A* Pathing algorithm onto the SmallWorld with comments
Applied A* Star to own Project
Wrote test cases for Project 3

1. Name: Victor Wu

2. Trigger the event via mouse click

3) World-Changing Event: Visualization
- A portal will show up in proximity to the mouse and color the surrounding area 3x3 tiles black to indicate dark matter. 


4) World Changing Event: Effect 
- When Dude comes into proximity within 5x5 of the mouse-click, Dude will change to a Super Dude entity. 
- Super Dude is evil, so he will actively seek out fairies and turn them into cars. 
- Super Dude is fast and can fly through and across any obstacles.
- Cars will remove trees completely 


5) World-Changing Event: New Entity
- Spawn a Soldier entity upon mouse click alongside the event.
- I drew this entity frame by frame via a pixel art website.
- Moves using A* algorithm 
- It will actively seek out Super Dudes and Cars, turning them into saplings into Fairies or Saplings, using Java's random. 
- The soldier's goal is to protect fairies.

Summary:
- Mouse-click triggers the event and turns tiles black, with a portal, and spawns a soldier.
- Event transforms Dudes into Super Dudes
- Super Dudes chase Fairies to turn them into Cars
- Cars remove any Plant Entity
- Soldiers turn Super Dudes and Cars into Fairies or Saplings using random.

I had no real central theme to this project, I just wanted to see how these different entities would interact with each other.
